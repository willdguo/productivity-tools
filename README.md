Various tools I've been developing for myself. Currently includes:

- Screentime tracker: currently on a Windows Surface, which doesn't have a built-in screentime checker

- Keyboard tracker: tracks key presses throughout a work session. When on screen, displays active keys. WIP

- Drink water: Reminds user to drink water every 15 or so minutes. Simple as that. Stay hydrated, folks.
